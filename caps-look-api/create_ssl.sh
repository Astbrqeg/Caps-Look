# First, generate a key file used for self-signed certificate generation with the command below. 
#The command will create a private key as a file called key.pem.

openssl genrsa -out key.pem

# Next, generate a certificate service request (CSR) with the command below.
# Youâ€™ll need a CSR to provide all of the input necessary to create the actual certificate.
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem



#Finally, generate your certificate by providing the private key created to sign it with the public key created in step two with an expiry date of 9,999 days.
# This command below will create a certificate called cert.pem.
openssl x509 -req -days 9999 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem
